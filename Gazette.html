            New Delhi: Making a strong case for his client, senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi has said politics is
            writ large over Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal being arrested both by the Enforcement Directorate
            and the CBI in the alleged liquor policy scam and that the approach taken by the prosecution is not one
            that would be adopted by "prosecutors or even persecutors".
            In an exclusive interview with NDTV on Friday, Mr Singhvi also claimed that the CBI taking the AAP chief
            into custody soon after he was granted bail in the ED case is proof that politics was at play and went
            on to coin a new term for this: "insurance arrest".

            The Congress leader's comments came hours after the Supreme Court granted Mr Kejriwal bail in the case
            under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act being investigated by the ED. The chief minister will,
            however, remain in jail because he is yet to get relief in the case filed by the CBI.

            When it was pointed out to him that the accused have been arrested by both CBI and the ED in the past, a
            combative Mr Singhvi said, "You are absolutely right, but just because something happens several times
            doesn't make it right."

            'Slips Of Tongue Happen': NATO Allies Back Gaffing Joe Biden
            German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Joe Biden "showed leadership for our common alliance."
            Washington: All was going according to plan. President Joe Biden was projecting himself as the leader of
            the free world as he hosted a NATO summit and then, in a moment, an embarrassing slip of the tongue.
            With Biden struggling to convince many Americans that he remains fit for office, NATO leaders have been
            offering him votes of confidence, however delicately, at least in part out of fear of another Donald
            Trump presidency.

            Biden was closing out NATO's three-day 75th-anniversary summit in Washington, vowing forcefully,
            "Ukraine will prevail" against Russian President Vladimir Putin and hailing the courage of Ukraine's
            iconic wartime leader, Voldymyr Zelensky.

                New Delhi: Indians travelled close to 1,000 cities across 68 countries over the year, a report
                revealed today.
                According to the ride-hailing platform Uber, summer holidays appear to be the most popular travel
                time for Indians to travel abroad as schools and colleges go into a break.

                The most popular month for overseas travel in 2023 was May, compared to June in 2022.

                "Indians have been breaking all travel records over the past couple of years," said Prabhjeet Singh,
                President, Uber India and South Asia.

                The data reflected a sharp increase in the number of Indians using the ridesharing app abroad during
                2023, with the number of overseas travellers being second only to Americans.

                Human Remains Found In Suitcases At UK Bridge, Manhunt Launched: Cops
                Cops said they were speaking to the driver of a taxi which took the man to the bridge. (File)


                London: British police have launched a manhunt after two suitcases which are believed to contain
                human remains were found at the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, south west England.
                Police said they had received a report of a man with a suitcase acting suspiciously on the bridge
                just before midnight on Wednesday but when they arrived he had already gone, leaving the suitcase
                behind. A second suitcase was also found nearby.

                The suitcases are believed to contain human remains, Avon and Somerset Police said in a statement on
                Thursday.

                "This is a very disturbing incident and I fully recognise the concern it will be causing our
                communities," Acting Bristol Commander Vicks Hayward-Melen said.

                "Our immediate priority is to locate the man who took the suitcases to the bridge, identify the
                bodies, and inform their next of kin."

                Berlin: Germany said Thursday it will phase out the use of components from Chinese telecom giants
                Huawei and ZTE in its 5G networks in the coming years due to national security concerns.
                Parts from the firms will no longer be used in "core" 5G mobile networks by the end of 2026 at the
                latest, the interior ministry said.

                In 5G access and transmission infrastructure, the systems of the telecom firms must be replaced by
                the end of 2029.

                "We are protecting the central nervous systems of Germany as a business location -- and we are
                protecting the communication of citizens, companies, and the state," said Interior Minister Nancy
                Faeser.

                "We must reduce security risks and, unlike in the past, avoid one-sided dependencies."

                The ministry said that 5G networks form part of Germany's "critical infrastructure" and are
                important for the functioning of sectors ranging from health to transport and energy.

                Rouen: The fire that broke out Thursday in the spire of the cathedral in the northern French city
                Rouen has been extinguished, local fire services said, with no major damage reported.
                A section of plastic sheeting covering renovation work 120 metres (400 feet) up the cathedral's
                spire caught fire, though officials have not said how the blaze started.

                Workers at the site first attempted to put out the fire and then alerted the departmental fire
                service, who raised the alarm around midday (1000 GMT). Some 40 vehicles and 70 firefighters
                responded to the scene.

                The city's mayor shared a photo of a column of smoke rising from the Gothic landmark.

                The fire was quickly brought "under control", said local fire chief Stephane Gouezec, and was
                declared extinguished at about 5 pm local time.

                "The interior was saved, above all the works of art," said Culture Minister Rachida Dati, who
                visited the scene at the request of President Emmanuel Macron.

                Taipei: Taiwan's defence ministry said Thursday it had detected 66 Chinese military aircraft around
                the island in a 24-hour window, a record-high this year, a day after it said Beijing was conducting
                exercises in nearby waters.
                China -- which maintains a near-daily military presence around Taiwan -- claims the self-ruled
                island as part of its territory and has said it will never renounce the use of force to bring it
                under its control.

                Thursday's record comes a day after Taipei spotted Chinese aircraft around the island that it said
                were headed to the western Pacific for exercises with the PLA aircraft carrier Shandong.

                "66 PLA aircraft and seven PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 am (2200
                GMT Wednesday) today," the defence ministry said in Thursday's statement, adding it has "responded
                accordingly".

                London: Scores of whales washed ashore in a "mass stranding" in Scotland's Orkney archipelago on
                Thursday, a British marine life rescue charity said.
                A total of 77 long-finned pilot whales were found on the island of Sanday in Orkney, off the
                northeastern coast of Scotland, after the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) received a
                report.

                When the BDMLR arrived, only a dozen whales were still alive, having been "stranded for several
                hours already", the animal rescue charity said.

                First aid was being provided to the surviving animals as the "incoming tide approaches them", it
                added.

                "Our team continues to work hard to manage this incredibly difficult situation", BDMLR said in the
                statement on its website, adding that help was also coming from the Scottish Marine Animal
                Strandings Scheme to probe the incident.
